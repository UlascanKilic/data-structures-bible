# Knight Jumps

Have the **_function KnightJumps(str)_** read **str** which will be a **str**ing consisting of the location of a knight on a standard 8x8 chess board with no other pieces on the board. The **str**ucture of **str** will be the following: "(x y)" which represents the position
of the knight with x and y ranging from 1 to 8.
Your program should determine the number of spaces the knight can move to from a given location. 
For example: if **str** is "(4 5)" then your program should output **8** because the knight can move to 8 different spaces from position x=4 and y=5.
