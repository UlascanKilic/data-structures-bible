# Additive Persistence
Have the **function AdditivePersistence(**num**)** take the **num** parameter being passed which will always be a positive integer and return its additive persistence which is the **num**ber of times you must add the digits in **num** until you reach a single digit. For example: if **num** is **2718 **then your program should return **2** because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9.
